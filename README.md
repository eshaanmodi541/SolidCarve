# SolidCarve

(insert image here)

SolidCrave is a 3-Axis CNC router capable of wood and alluminum. With a steel tube frame, it is cheap and rigid. The goal of this project was to make Alluminum cutting more accessible for a great price. Coming in at around $400 the welded frame and fixed gantry approach makes for a very rigid machine with a convinient build area of 450mm x 400mm.
