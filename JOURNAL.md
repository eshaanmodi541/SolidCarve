## 10/10/2025 - Idea-fication for CNC  

For the past few days I have been searching to see if making a _good_ router under 400 dollars is even possible. It should cut wood very well, and should be able to get decent results with aluminum plates. I only need 18in by 18in cutting space.

I first started looking online and on YouTube for videos of people who made a CNC router just to see how difficult it would be. Honestly, the assembly did not look too bad, since they were using aluminum extrusion. So, I made a generic sketch of what I wanted the machine to look like and what materials I would need:

## **1. FRAME**

This is one of the most important variable to making a capable machine (according to ChatGPT) so I started looking online for aluminum extrusions, just like I saw in the videos. Turns out aluminum in a specific shape is EXPENSIVE. Now, I had no idea how the budget would be split, so I thought it would all work out. But after I estimated the costs for everything else, I realized the frame could not be made out of aluminum extrusion. 

There are two other options that could work for me:
Wood
Steel tubes

Both have their pros and cons, but wood is probably way too flimsy for aluminum cutting, which I really need. The problem with Steel tubes is not the price (they are pretty cheap) but the tools required to actually assemble everything. You would either need a welder (no way) or a bunch of brackets and bolts. But to attach bolt onto steel, you need a capable drill or drill-press, and a good tap to make threads. Also a saw to cut the tubes. Luckily, if you buy all the tools on Facebook marketplace, the final price is STILL half the price of aluminum extrusions, and I get a bunch of free tools as well. 

Besides the frame material, I have not yet designed anything, which is the next step. 

## **2. ROUTER/SPINDLE**

This is what most people think of when they learn about the cnc router. But, surprisingly the router is not nearly as important as the frame rigidity. This is why I decided to go with the popular Makita router which I can get on ebay for 50 - 75 dollars. This should save me from all the extra stuff in buying a plain motor (spindle). 

## **3. LINEAR GUIDE**

Forget the frame, THIS is the most important thing for the whole project. Linear guides can make or break a cnc router. I had 5 main choices:

Genuine Linear rails (too expensive: budget is blown just on these)
Ali Express Linear rails (It is hard to get consistent products)
Linear rod (too flimsy)
V wheels and aluminum extrusion (I am already using flat steel tubes and it is still too flimsy)
SUPPORTED linear rails (perfect balance of price and rigidity)

I decided to go with supported linear rails. They are popular in DIY builds and should not take more than 100 - 150 dollars of the budget I hope.

## **4. ELECTRONICS/MOTOR**

This is pretty straightforward. I will go with NEMA 17 or NEMA 23 stepper motors. I will probably start the brain with an Arduino with shield or an old laptop with stepper drivers. The electronics are the most upgradable part of the build I think, so I am not too worried about this.

## **5. MISC**

This includes the spoil board, bits for cutting, and all the nuts, bolts, etc. This should not cost more than $50.

## **Budget:**

Frame: $50 - $75 including tools
Router: $50 - $75 (Makita)
Linear guides: $100 - $150
Electronics: $100
Misc: $50

The total is $350 - $450 which is pretty good. I can pay the difference if the cnc ends up a few over. 

## **farewell**

I spent 14hrs over 1 week just researching this project (I am highly inefficient) and I think I have enough of a foundation to design the build in Fusion360. I have attached picture of metal tube because there is not much else to show.
