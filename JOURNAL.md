## 10/10/2025 - Idea-fication for CNC  

For the past few days I have been searching to see if making a _good_ router under 400 dollars is even possible. It should cut wood very well, and should be able to get decent results with aluminum plates. I only need 18in by 18in cutting space.

I first started looking online and on YouTube for videos of people who made a CNC router just to see how difficult it would be. Honestly, the assembly did not look too bad, since they were using aluminum extrusion. So, I made a generic sketch of what I wanted the machine to look like and what materials I would need:

## **1. FRAME**

This is one of the most important variable to making a capable machine (according to ChatGPT) so I started looking online for aluminum extrusions, just like I saw in the videos. Turns out aluminum in a specific shape is EXPENSIVE. Now, I had no idea how the budget would be split, so I thought it would all work out. But after I estimated the costs for everything else, I realized the frame could not be made out of aluminum extrusion. 

There are two other options that could work for me:
Wood
Steel tubes

Both have their pros and cons, but wood is probably way too flimsy for aluminum cutting, which I really need. The problem with Steel tubes is not the price (they are pretty cheap) but the tools required to actually assemble everything. You would either need a welder (no way) or a bunch of brackets and bolts. But to attach bolt onto steel, you need a capable drill or drill-press, and a good tap to make threads. Also a saw to cut the tubes. Luckily, if you buy all the tools on Facebook marketplace, the final price is STILL half the price of aluminum extrusions, and I get a bunch of free tools as well. 

Besides the frame material, I have not yet designed anything, which is the next step. 

## **2. ROUTER/SPINDLE**

This is what most people think of when they learn about the cnc router. But, surprisingly the router is not nearly as important as the frame rigidity. This is why I decided to go with the popular Makita router which I can get on ebay for 50 - 75 dollars. This should save me from all the extra stuff in buying a plain motor (spindle). 

## **3. LINEAR GUIDE**

Forget the frame, THIS is the most important thing for the whole project. Linear guides can make or break a cnc router. I had 5 main choices:

Genuine Linear rails (too expensive: budget is blown just on these)
Ali Express Linear rails (It is hard to get consistent products)
Linear rod (too flimsy)
V wheels and aluminum extrusion (I am already using flat steel tubes and it is still too flimsy)
SUPPORTED linear rails (perfect balance of price and rigidity)

I decided to go with supported linear rails. They are popular in DIY builds and should not take more than 100 - 150 dollars of the budget I hope.

## **4. ELECTRONICS/MOTOR**

This is pretty straightforward. I will go with NEMA 17 or NEMA 23 stepper motors. I will probably start the brain with an Arduino with shield or an old laptop with stepper drivers. The electronics are the most upgradable part of the build I think, so I am not too worried about this.

## **5. MISC**

This includes the spoil board, bits for cutting, and all the nuts, bolts, etc. This should not cost more than $50.

## **Budget:**

Frame: $50 - $75 including tools
Router: $50 - $75 (Makita)
Linear guides: $100 - $150
Electronics: $100
Misc: $50

The total is $350 - $450 which is pretty good. I can pay the difference if the cnc ends up a few over. 

## **farewell**

I spent 14hrs over 1 week just researching this project (I am highly inefficient) and I think I have enough of a foundation to design the build in Fusion360. I have attached picture of metal tube because there is not much else to show.

## 10/15/2025 - Made a rough design of the CNC  

So for the past 5 days, I have been struggling to design this robot. But before we get into that here are af ew changes to the design:

Alluminum extrusion instead of steel tube: Steel takes so much equipment and Maintainance which I underestimated. Alluminum extrusions have more of an upfront cost, but for my first machine, the ease of assembly and maintenance will outweigh the rigidity of the steel. Besides, my machine Is not too large. 

Fixed gantry: I have no idea if I went over this last time, but I am going to be using a fixed gantry design instead of a moving gantry. I just find fixed gantries much more straightforward and rigid to build even though they take up more space.

linear rails: I decided that even though linear rails cost a LOT, if I plan my budget properly, I should be able to use them. I am not too sure about this right now, but my rough draft does use linear rails currently.

OK, so now back to what I have been doing for the last 5 days. I first started just going straight into modeling something (I dont really have too much cad experience), but it ended up like this.

Now It might not look too bad, and honestly I dont really remember why I restarted, but I did. V2 looked like this:

![Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 7.12.13 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7f8c37bba59e64f21e576e464e8f0da52a038223/Screenshot%202025-10-15%20at%207.12.13%E2%80%AFPM.png)

not the most beautiful or thought out design. I think the problem was I just started modeling the final copy without even knowing my design yet.

After some time, I realized that this design was not going to work, so I decided I would restart it AGAIN but this time with the z axis assembly, because that felt like its own little thing seperate from the rest

![Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 7.14.10 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e74ddb63b6d3fc713c83c628d2628cb4d95080e7/Screenshot%202025-10-15%20at%207.14.10%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Geuss how long this took. 2 hours. Honestly I dont know how the time flew by, but I am guessing it was because every time I added something, I first looked at the price of it on Ali express, then I found a good cad model on grabbed, then I put it into the design without even having a plan for how everything was going to work together. I realized this wouldn't work. and I decided I should design everything on paper first.

Here's the thing, I suck at drawing. I have no sense of dimension. So I decided I would make my rough copy on fusion. This way it was easier to see how everything would work together, before added screws and complex shapes. So, in about 1 hour, I whipped up this very very rough draft.

![Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 7.17.38 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9a328ac6e8953c41e575855f0abeed98b6d98edc/Screenshot%202025-10-15%20at%207.17.38%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Honestly, even on a design standpoint, this looks probably worse than the others, but the point is I have some idea of how this will look. tomorrow I can refine the rough draft, and then work piece by piece to bring it into a final product. So I am pretty proud of it :)

Ok bye.

  

## 10/16/2025 - Beefed up the rough draft  

Today I beefed up the cnc router rough draft with some brackets, feet, extra beams, plates, etc. I also switched back to steel because aluminum is way too expensive. I will probably switch back and forth a few times while I am designing though. So far the plan should be to finish the draft tomorrow and finish the final cad over the long weekend my school has.

## 10/20/2025 - modeled the base frame.  

I turned the rough draft of the base from last journal and turned into something that COULD be built. It's not perfect, and probably more of a rough draft than a final product, but I am pretty happy about how it turned out. I do want to change the piece that connects the ball screw to the plate, but that can wait. Also I didn't put in the ball screw brackets because they top not need any extra pieces and can just be screwed on to the steel tube.

## 10/21/2025 - modeled the z axis  

Topday I modeled the z axis. Honestly, I think I like it more than the base frame since the pieces look less awkward and it came together pretty well. I made it a little too long because the tool doesn't reach all the way down when I raise it up but it is honestly fine. I am moving to the y axis which I hope will be easier
